# AW-Strat-Tester
A Patch to test Strategys on Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.

This strat tester is for advanced warfare zombie. Created by Foedie, llGaryyll & rFancy. 

You can use 2 commands, start_round and wait_start.
 
You will automatically have perks and exo when you spawn in.
Weapons are included too when you spawn on the map. You will just need to press the switch weapon button for the weapons to show up.
About commands, that work like for the "fast_restart" for example. You open the command and write the command "start_round" or "wait_start". 
For "start_round" you have to add the round you want to start at. For example with "start_round 100", you will spawn on round 100. 
For "wait_start" that's the time before the zombies spawn on the map, this command work in second. For example, "wait_start 90" zombies will spawn after 90sec.
When you changed the round and/or the waiting, you will need to make a "fast_restart" and you will have the good round and the good waiting.
Godmode command is available too. You will only need to use the command and write "god"

Good thing to know, the command "wait_start" doesn't work on Infection.
The toxic zones and survivors round can be fucked too, like have 2 consecutive toxic rounds or survivors.
The Goliath on Infection can be different too, like don't spawn during a 9 round like it normally do.
Final thing to know, the rounds after 162 are not playable. You can change the round in 163+ but nothing will kill zombies.
No problem, it's just the strat_tester. In a real game, you can make 163+ on pc without problem (did in the past)
